      <p>My name is Andrew Davies. I graduated from the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign Winter 2010 with a
        degree in Economics. Shortly thereafter I began embarking on a path that led me to becoming a web developer.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have worked on numerous projects. My favorite would have to be participating in the creation
        of a mobile iOS game Alien Hero as a digital data analyst. The game was featured as a top new game in the
        Apple store. Most recently, I helped optimize a website for a financial firm: Chakra Advisors. A quick search
        of their company name and you will find they currently sit at the top spot on Google and on the front page
        of Bing and Yahoo. </p>
    <p>For fun, I enjoy photography and learning graphic design. I also am extremely interested in music and love attending
        concerts and music festivals. </p>
